I was never without a book as a child. My mother had, through patience and insistence, instiled in me a love of escaping into a fictional world. 

I'd forgotten that. 

These days news feeds, reddit, youtube, twitch, instagram, facebook and linkedin give me all the escape with little of the benefit of being entrhralled in the artistry of a well structured novel. I would always have a book on the go, sure - but I'd get a quarter of the way in and then plateau, adding it to the ever growing stack of to-be-completed books on the bedside table. I'd forgotten I loved reading. I'd forgotten what that even felt like. It was only seeing Susi's kids reading on holiday that I dimly remembered that that used to be me. 

I'm a New Years Resolutioneer who has graduated from naive expectations of overnight transformations, through to grim acceptance of my weak willed intransigence, through Tim Ferris's suggestions of New Year's _review_ rather than New Year's _promise_, through to ..._drumroll_... 2024's **totally reasonable resolutions**. This year was going to be different - I was going to make resolutions that would be trivial to do. And I was doing to do them. And do them, I most certainly did not. 

It was August before I summoned up the gumption to review **totally reasonable resolutions** - glumly anticipating that life had gotten in the way of the improvements I'd intended to make. But then I found I kinda had made a fair bit of progress on most of them, and I applauded 2023 Julian's wisdom in making the resolutions **totally reasonable**. However. I had intended to read 12 books in the year - that's a book a month by the way - **totally reasonable**, right? It was month 8 and I was onto book 0.5. This didn't look good.

I had circled the prospect of getting into 40k minature painting as a mature age geek for at least 3 years. If you know, you know. My high school mates had been chaos, eldar, and imperium epic players - I never had the pocket money to match them and would just watch enviously. The hobby enjoyed an explosion of interest over the covid lockdowns - to the point where buying and reselling boxes at a substantial mark up became a viable business. But I never made the plunge - I reasoned that my aged eyes and manual dexterity were not up to the task of putting 3 dots and an underline on the pixel-sized adeptes astartes visor as the gun tiktok miniature painters recommended. But Susi gave me a starter pack, and eventually I gave it go - I didn't have to make it perfect, I just had to make it mine. Abandoning perfection seems to be a good first step on the road to competency. 

If abandoning perfection allowed me to take up miniature painting, maybe abandoning pefection could help reading my dozen books.
