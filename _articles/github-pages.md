Some links to get up and running with github pages. May contain traces of ruby.

* [jekyll quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
* [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) is a nice looking theme 
* [syntax highlighting](https://jun711.github.io/web/how-to-highlight-code-on-a-Jekyll-site-syntax-highlighting/) seems to be default now, no need to add in.
* [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
