While working for REA under the leadership of the inimitable Theresa Neate, the Senior QA group were required to complete a skills assessment. The framework was well articulated and concise. We dutifully completed our self assessments. A few days later Theresa posted my all time favourite slack response: 

<blockquote> Hi team, I have reviewed the QA Wheel submissions. Your responses have made me think, cringe, and cry. </blockquote>

Let's just say the first cut of our self assessments were more... aspirational than the exercise strictly required. With patient coaching from T we eventually ended up with a greater degree of accuracy and perhaps some insight.

I'm always conflicted when reviewing
A technical skills matrix is a mandatory component of a tech resume. I find it a fraught exercise, and have never been happy with mine. 
It's also a lot of information to cram into a resume..

When reviewing a resume I am ticked off by answers I dislike

Measure of expertise
* years? 
* self rating: Dunning Kruger

Completeness
* old skills

Context
* what did you use it for? as a qa or a developer? 
* how long ago was it?

My solution is here: 

skill - 3 point rating - description
- novice - are you oriented enough to know where to go to answer your own questions? Do you know the domain terminology? 
- familiar - could you coach someone in installing, configuring, starting their first project with it? 
- regular - have you used it daily for a least month or more?. Can you highlight its strengths and weaknesses compared to similar offerings?
- in house expert - do you have strong opinions on its usage? are you the person other people come to for help?

example: mongodb
