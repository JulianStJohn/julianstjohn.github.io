While working for REA under the leadership of the inimitable Theresa Neate, the Senior QA group were required to complete a skills assessment. The framework was well articulated and concise. We dutifully completed our self assessments. A few days later Theresa posted my all time favourite slack response: 

<blockquote> Hi team, I have reviewed the QA Wheel submissions. Your responses have made me think, cringe, and cry. </blockquote>

Let's just say the first cut of our self assessments were more... _aspirational_ than the exercise strictly required. With patient coaching from T we eventually ended up with a greater degree of accuracy and perhaps some insight.

You can't blame us, as employees we're intrinsically motivated to mark ourselves as competent and invaluable as modesty allows. And we were QAs at a leading digital company, surely we're up the top end of the bracket for the necessary skills?

When reviewing a resume I am ticked off by answers I dislike

Measure of expertise
* years? 
* self rating: Dunning Kruger

Completeness
* old skills

Context
* what did you use it for? as a qa or a developer? 
* how long ago was it?

My solution is here: 


Julian's easy 5 point rating system
skill - 3 point rating - description
- novice - are you oriented enough to know where to go to answer your own questions? Do you know the domain terminology? 
- familiar - could you coach someone in installing, configuring, starting their first project with it? 
- regular - have you used it daily for a least month or more?. Can you highlight its strengths and weaknesses compared to similar offerings?
- in-house expert - do you have strong opinions on its usage? are you the person other people come to for help?
- industry expert - author, keynote speaker, other in-house-experts routinely ask you for help, contributed to the codebase

example: mongodb
